Angular Assignment: Building a Task Management App

Objective: In this assignment, you will create a simple Task Management app using Angular that demonstrates your understanding of components, modules, directives, pipes, and parent-child relationships in Angular.

Requirements:

Your Task Management app should have the following features:

Components:

Create a component for the main app layout.

Create a component to display a list of tasks.

Create a component for adding new tasks.

Modules:

Organize your app into separate modules for better organization.

Create a feature module for the task-related components.

Directives:

Implement a directive that highlights tasks based on their priority (low, medium, high).

Use another directive to disable the "Mark as Done" button for completed tasks.

Pipes:

Create a custom pipe to filter tasks by their status (done/undone).

Implement the built-in DatePipe to display task creation dates.

Data Binding:

Use property binding to display the task details.

Implement event binding for the "Mark as Done" button.

Parent-Child Relationship:

Create a parent component that manages the task list and the "Add Task" component.

Establish communication between the parent and child components to add and update tasks.

Instructions:

Set up a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.

Create the necessary components: app-layout, task-list, and add-task.

Organize your components into separate modules: AppModule and a feature module for tasks.

Implement the required directives for highlighting and disabling tasks.

Create the necessary pipes for filtering tasks and displaying dates.

Implement data binding to display task information and handle events.

Create a parent component that manages the task list and the add task functionality.

Implement the necessary logic to add tasks and mark them as done.
